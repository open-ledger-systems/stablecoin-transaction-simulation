## Overview
**Flash USDT (F.USDT)** is often misunderstood online. It refers both to experimental time-bound token concepts and to high-risk software claims.  

This repository demonstrates how **real USDT transactions operate** at the protocol level using **mock tokens and simulations** — **without using real funds**. It is strictly **educational and research-focused**.

## Background
### 1. Time-Bound Token Concepts
Some experimental implementations of “Flash USDT” involve **time-limited TRC-20 tokens** used for:
- Short-cycle value distribution  
- Merchant ecosystems or remittance networks  

These systems may include:
- Deterministic token lifecycles (e.g., 160-day expiration)  
- Deployment on high-throughput blockchains like TRON  
- Controlled issuance for testing or research  

**Note:** These are not equivalent to official USDT and are not for open-market trading.

### 2. High-Risk Software Claims
Many online tools claiming to generate “Flash USDT” often:
- Display temporary balances  
- Claim to bypass blockchain confirmations  
- Require paid licenses  

⚠️ Such tools are frequently fraudulent and should be treated with extreme caution.

### 3. Tokens Named “Flash USDT”
Various low-liquidity tokens with names like “F.USDT” exist on chains like:
- BNB Smart Chain (BEP-20)  
- Solana  

These tokens:
- Often have high supply but low circulation  
- Trade below $1 USD  
- Are **not backed by Tether**

## About This Project
This repository demonstrates **how USDT transactions work in a blockchain environment** using:
- **Mock tokens and ledger simulations**  
- Visualization of transaction states and confirmations  
- Explanation of why “flash” USDT claims are technically impossible  

**Key Features:**
- Educational and research-oriented  
- No interaction with mainnet  
- Safe to run on local machines or test networks
